# FittedDrawable
This is a library which creates Drawables for Android that perfectly fits its content - text or an image - into a rectangle, rounded rectangle or circle. For image the background gets cleverly continued (for details see `android.graphics.Shader.TileMode`). 
This library was first created to serve our needs at [Stocard](http://stocard.de) but in the meantime also found its way into other project.
 
 There is still a lot room for improvements, PRs are welcome ;-)

#### Simple usage:

Rectangle
```kotlin
FittedBitmapDrawable bitmapDrawable = new FittedBitmapDrawable(context, R.drawable.android, ROUND_RECTANGLE)
imageView.setImageDrawable(bitmapDrawable)
```
or circle
```kotlin
FittedBitmapDrawable bitmapDrawable = new FittedBitmapDrawable(context, R.drawable.android, ROUND)
imageView.setImageDrawable(bitmapDrawable)
```

#### For fancier results set the tile mode `.setTileMode(Shader.TileMode.CLAMP);` 

```kotlin
FittedBitmapDrawable bitmapDrawable = new FittedBitmapDrawable(context, R.drawable.android, ROUND_RECTANGLE)
bitmapDrawable.setTileMode(Shader.TileMode.CLAMP)
imageView.setImageDrawable(bitmapDrawable)

```

### Get it via Jitpack
Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Step 2. Add the dependency
```groovy
dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.tobiasschuerg:FittedDrawable:Tag'
}
```
